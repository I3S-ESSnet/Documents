## Presentations

The [slides.html](slides.html) can be used as a template to make simple presentations using [Reveal](https://revealjs.com/) and Markdown.

The Markdown code can be entered directly in the HTML file or in the specific [slides.md](slides.md) Markdown file. The example HTML file demonstrates both options. Also, various possibilities are shown for slides separators (new lines, dashes...), but these are just examples (*NB*: on Windows, it may be necessary to replace `\n` by `\r\n` in separator regular expressions).

More information on using Markdown in Reveal can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown). Of course, it is also possible to use [usual Reveal markup](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#instructions) in the HTML file.

To use the presentation template, copy [slides.html](slides.html) and optionally [slides.md](slides.md) to the desired location and start editing. *NB*: prefer Firefox when editing external Mardown locally, as Chrome [does not allow](http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/) file access (to slides.md) from file (slides.html).
