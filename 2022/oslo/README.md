# Oslo hackathon

### Date: 25-27 July 2022
### Venue: SSB


The meeting aims to prolong the work done during the I3S ESSnet. It will cover two main topics:

* Further development of I3S tools, ie [Trevas](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas)
* Brain-storming on how to organize sustainable sharing of solutions in the ESS based on open source

## Development

The work will focus on the [Trevas roadmap](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas/milestone/4), but participants are also welcome to submit VTL transformation or validation use cases for test and benchmark. Use cases should include the VTL script or its specification and the corresponding data (real or synthetic/anonymized, full size or sample).

## Brain-storming

The goal is to contribute to the reflections going on in the ESS on how to share solutions and building blocks, in particular in the perspective of the DGINS meeting on innovation in October. Specific subjects will include:

* lessons learned and case studies 
* governance and communication
* roles, in particular for Eurostat
* assessment of solutions quality
* architectural guidelines
* etc.

[Preliminary reflections](../ssm/shared-statistical-methods.md) will provide a base for the discussions.
