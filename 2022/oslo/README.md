# Oslo 2022 meeting

### Date: 25-27 July 2022
### Venue: SSB


The meeting aims to look back and prolong the work done during the I3S ESSnet. More than one year after the end of the project, it is useful to assess the progress made and elaborate on the conclusions drawn, especially in the light of the growing effort going on in Europe around [interoperability](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperable-europe).

In order to avoid an overly theoretical approach, the reflection will be based on a concrete use case. Given the progress already made between Insee, SCB and Eurostat, it is proposed that this use case be made up of the VTL tools ([editor](https://github.com/eurostat/vtl-editor), [execution engine](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas) and [lab](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/VTL-Lab)).

The meeting will thus cover two main topics:

* Brain-storming on how to organize sustainable sharing of solutions in the ESS based on Open Source
* Further development of I3S tools, specifically [Trevas](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas) and [lab](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/VTL-Lab)) in the light of the ideas produced by the brain-storming.


## Brain-storming

### Objectives

The goal is to contribute to the reflections going on in the ESS on how to share solutions and building blocks, in particular in the perspective of the DGINS meeting on innovation in October. Specific subjects will include:

* lessons learned and case studies 
* governance and communication
* use of GitHub and Open Source principles for collaboration
* roles, in particular for Eurostat
* assessment of solutions quality
* architectural guidelines

Use case for this session can be the sharing and co-development of statistical methods.

### References

* [Preliminary reflections](../ssm/shared-statistical-methods.md) by Trygve provide a base for the discussions.
* Also interesting are the [recommendations](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperable-europe/news/official-expert-recommendations-new-interoperability-policy) recently made by the Expert group on the Interoperability of European Public Services


## Development

Regarding the execution engine, the work will focus on the [Trevas roadmap](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas/milestone/4), and participants are welcome to submit beforehabd VTL transformation or validation use cases for test and benchmark. Use cases should include the VTL script or its specification and the corresponding data (real or synthetic/anonymized, full size or sample).

The development of the VTL Lab will be guided by the reflexions conducted in the brain-storming thread, so it is not possible to specify the roadmap in advance. What is important is to organize a good communication between the threads and a fluid and agile management of the development activities.


## Detailed agenda

As indicated, two main streams will structure the meeting: one oriented towards the brain-storming, and one on the study and developement of the example case with the requirement that tight coordination be maintained between them. A proposed agenda is provided below, which will be adapted during the meeting depending on the results obtained.
