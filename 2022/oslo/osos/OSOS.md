# OSOS

## Problem statement
- Propose principles
- Provide a open source guide
- Provide a technical guidance
- Project Template?

Different approaches to Open Source, and different motivation ([The benefits of coding in the open - Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open)). The scope of this document should be within Open Source projects that have a broader appeal to other statistical offices.

- [EC code of practice](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/fr/web/quality/european-quality-standards/european-statistics-code-of-practice)


Maintenance of projects when people leave 
Responsibility to community, documentation, project lead, roadmaps
Life cycle 
How to identify projects that require more structure.
- maintenance challenges, one person projects/systems
- single source of truth, lifecycle and documentation
- distinguish official and experimental deliveries
- Insee : discrepancies between internal repo and public (GitHub) ones
- SDC tau argus : technological issues
- Why’s and how’s could be different for statistical methods and more IT softwares

Open source publication/open source adoption: scope of the group? Both aspects are related but different (open source adoption precedes open source publication)

Insee two repositories:
[https://github.com/InseeFr](https://github.com/InseeFr) <- More official
[https://github.com/InseeFrLab](https://github.com/InseeFrLab) <- Less official (can be moved to the more official one)
