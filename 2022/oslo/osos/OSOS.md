Different approaches to Open Source, and different motivation ([The benefits of coding in the open - Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open)). The scope of this document should be within Open Source projects that have a broader appeal to other statistical offices.
