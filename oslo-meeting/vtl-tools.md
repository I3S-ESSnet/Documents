# I3S ESSnet "Oslo" meeting - Presentation on VTL Tools

## Reminder about VTL


## Recent developments on VTL

### Update of grammar 2.0 published

Also upgrade to SDMX 2.1.

Lots of improvements, but remaining inefficiencies (duplication of scalar/component expressions).

Governance is still unclear. Grammar evolution was untraceable. Feedback not organized.
