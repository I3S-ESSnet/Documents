# Oslo meeting - minutes

## Deliverables

Resubmit D1.2.1, ARC Service because things have evolved since the last submission, and see with Pierre.

D2.1 : final version in M24, and last months to really finalize
also for Cookbook
for the communication deliverable, more a draft on M24

D3.1.1 : blueprint, it is a draft, sthg is on github, part documentation, part code, try the way to present the result in a proper way
now final is M28, but it will be a good thing to begin to deploy the services before M27

During Toulouse hackathon, Pierre Peyronnel was precise on what he wanted in the service deliverables

Deliverable 1.5, Guidelines and best practise, have a discussion around the document in order to move forward, during this hackathon, during the next one.
Possible overlaps with other deliverables (architecture).
Focusing the guideline on the experience and practise of integrating and reusing

## Budget

Staff cost ; Sweden around 100%

Subcontract :
### Insee
==> security audits for ARC, Relais and PXWeb, for Relais and PXWeb tell Insee when the code will be stable
### Istat
a consultant , Relais is a little bit monolithic, the idea of the subcontracting is to break Relais in smaller pieces (so for security audit : wait another few months), so subcontract is about Relais architecture. Not all the budget will be used (check how this budget can be reused)
### Norway
most of the money is still not used, plan to use it for the Google platform

## Communication actions
What do we do for NTTS ? Deadline for abstract in november.
ModernStat Workshop, deadline in septembre.
Discussion at the end of the meeting.
Ohter ideas ?
