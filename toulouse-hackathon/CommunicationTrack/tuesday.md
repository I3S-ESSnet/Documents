## Communication track - work done on Tuesday

  * First presentation of the jDemetra+ flyer and first feedbacks
  * Review of the guidelines to advertise a shared service success story and feedbacks
  * Discussion about the groups of targeted people and how to contact them, through DIME/ITDG, through Eurostat WG, through EABoard ... (for the groups at Eurostat see https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/node_en , "Groups" tab)
  * The guidelines are a list of questions, these questions could be combined into example templates. First templates could be defined using the first made flyers.
  * The list of questions in the guidelines has been validated.
  * "is it possible to contribute to the development ?" ==> question of the opensrouce strategy of NSIs (Eurostat and Stats Sweden have)
  * For the information in the Catalogue see https://www.statistical-services.org/ . The catalogue can be used to give informations on the services and can be linked in the flyers, then it is very important to publish information in the catalogue.
  * "Relais_flyer_Images_rev3.docx" is the most complete flyer for Relais, it is for a general audience, the other is more for the methodologists. The second one flyer will be used to make a template.
  * The flyers are deliverables for the ESSNet, they could be distributed during the workshop in Lisbon or any other communication event (for example the Q2020 conference). After the ESSNet, each country would be responsible for making evolve its own flyers if it think it is necessary.


Proposition for a flyer template (with propositions of questions in order to help filling the different parts):
  * Header (What is the name of the service ? Who is the source of the service ?)
  * Service description: history (How long has it been used ? Is it used in other NSIs ?), functionalities (Which problem is solved ?), architecture
  * Conditions of using
  * Documentation and additional resources, link to the Catalogue (What is the channel to obtain the service ? Is a manuel available ? Is there any help desk ?)
  * Future development
  * License
  * Contact
