  * Will it be a Catalogue app ? It can be an enhancement of the filters, for example to also propose a more user-friendly application
  * The first question is the GSBPM phases or subprocess ==> the first choice could presented as an image of the GSBPM
  * criterias in the Catalogue: license type is important (proprietary, free but proprietary, opensource "not viral", opensrouce "viral")
in the Sinder we only show tool with "final" in status and "implementation" in type of document
  * technology criteria: java/dotNet/JS/R/other
  * for methodology, it is difficult to build a decision tree in order to precise what is searched for, perhaps could we just propose standard/non standard ?
  * allow people to add questions in the Catalogue so that these questions can be used by the Sinder ?
