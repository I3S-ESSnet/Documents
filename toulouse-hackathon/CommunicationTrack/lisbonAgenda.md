## Lisbon workshop agenda


  * 2 or 3 days ?
  * Who ? ESS or CSPA community ? It depends on the capacity of the room at INE. We need a big room for the plenary, and some smaller rooms for the small groups sessions.

### 2 days option

first day morning (9:00 to 12:30):
  * results of the ESSNet (all the morning)

first day afternoon "Beyond the ESSNet" (14:00 to 17:30):
  * icebreaker (30 minutes)
  * lessons learnt and open points in the ESSNet (and the survey) (30 minutes)
  * additional questions (and the answers) for the survey, not in plenary but in small groups (1 hour)
  * coffee break
  * restitutions in plenary (15 minutes)
  
  
second day morning "CSPA session":
  * presentation of CSPA 2.0 (30 minutes)
  * the catalogue (30 minutes)
  * the Sinder (30 minutes)
  * coffee break
  * VTL presentation (1 hour)
  
second day afternoon "Practical session":
  * Contenairisation for the dummies
  * "I build my statistical process with the services in the Caatalogue", in small groups


Other ideas taken in the Wiesbaden agenda:
  * other NSIs presentation of one of their services
  * session on architecture ?
  * presnetation of the awesome list by CBS, what do you do with that ?
  * opensource strategy of NSIs ?
