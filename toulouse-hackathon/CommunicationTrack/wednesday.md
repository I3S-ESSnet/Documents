## Communication track - work done on Wednesday

  * Try to have an additional colect for the non-respondent ? Try to ask the next Steering committee of the DIME/ITDG (in february) to endorse this complementary survey ? SG Members : Austria, Germany, Danemark, Spain, France, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherland, Poland, Sweden and Slovenia.
  * Sharing countries : France (questionnaire generation), Sweden (PXWeb), Italy (StatMatch, CIRCE, Selemix, Genesis), CBS (cf. the Catalogue), Croatia (?), Spain (?)
  * it is not clear if all these tools are in the Catalogue or the awesome list (https://github.com/SNStatComp/awesome-official-statistics-software)
  * reuse by countries : Danemark reuse PXWeb
  * and what about SDMX tools, every country use them. Do the NSI understand that ruse means that you install your own instance ? If yes we are missing something. Is it necessary to have a category "use a central tool"
  * seems difficult to reopen the survey for everybody ==> to make a live survey during the Lisbon workshop ?
  * main incentives for sharing AND reusing are : first ==> quality/standards, second ==> cost. The will to have a community of developers in an opensource approach does not appear.
