# Paris meeting - 14-16 January 2021

## Kick-Off session

### Track 1 description

Architecture recommandations structure :
* 1st, the why : a section focusing on the business drivers
* 2nd, the what : "we want to be metadata driven"
* 3rd, the how

The cookbook is divided in 2 parts : 1st on ARC and Relais, 2nd on schoolbook examples.

Schoolbook examples :
* Scenario 1 : starting point and goal, the goal is the starting point for the scenario 2
* The goal of scenario 2 is context aware
* For scenario 3, once again the goal of scenario 2 is the starting point. Scenario 3 implements a new feature which is event driven.
* In scenario 4 we want to implement the contenairisation feature.

During the track, we will work on the schoolbook scenario 1. The two services to be created are CAWI and Error Location.
