# Report on lessons learned
WP 3 has as overall objectives provide a blueprint og implementating the blueprint to be able to establish and build a sandbox environment and test available services in a containerized enviroment. The environment has been used to perform functional tests of services (see WP 1), and validate their packaging and installation. 

Methods and technologies for containerization has been studied and guidelines (D3.1.1. - Blueprint) and resources (D3.1.2. - Implementing the blueprint) has been delivered. The blueprint document provides an overall description for establishing a runtime environment for implementing modern sharable services following the CSPA standards and principles as containers. Within the document we have described the concepts, guidelines and considerations for providing and developing services, as well describing some considerations related to security and logging. Implementing the blueprint provides examples on implementations using the concept of "Infrastructure as code" as well as how to implement sharable services on these platforms. 

In the following sections of this document we will discuss some of the identified challenges related to establishing an enviroment for implementation of sharable services, and also give examples of success. 

Even though there has been challenges and obstacles in the process we do think that we have met the objectives as described in the project description. The collaboration with WP 1 and WP 2 has been important, both for binding the overall architecture descriptions to the technical architecture description in the blueprint og implementing the blueprint as well as the collaboration (discussions and deployathons) as proof-of-concepts and improvement of the processes to provide a platform for implementing shared services.

## Documenting blueprint for implementation purpose
* Concepts
* Technology change
* Granularity of documentation

CD, governance, management. Theoretical approach. 
Challenges related to shared platform and governance, management. 

To keep track over two years (projects). Important elements when started the project has changed over time. Fail fast, change.

Other existing artefacts related to the blueprint.

## Experience with deployathons
* "Agile approach", not sufficient to apply guidelines and requirements. Agile and team approach.
* Windows containters
* Add from document Implementing blueprint
* Security issues
