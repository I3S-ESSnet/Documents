# Why Open Source matters
The use of open source provides greater freedom to choose both products and technology that are right for your organization. It makes it easier to choose as little or as much as one needs at any given time. It also gives your organization the freedom to choose vendors and expertise in the market. 

Sharing code nationally and internationally improve quality and encourage reuse of code across organizations and borders.

## Implications
* The right competence to choose the right products for the right purposes, in addition to basic knowledge of open source licensing
* In order to share code internationally, English should (must?) be used as a development language
* Make sure that code is decomposed so that specific business logic is separated from the code that may be of general interest
* When suspending all or part of the development, must your organization enure that you have the copyright to the code being developed and/or ensure that the source code can be shared under an open license
* There may be reasons why one chooses products/solutions that are not open source, but then quality, scope and degree to which the product provides for strong links to the architecture must be assessed and documented
