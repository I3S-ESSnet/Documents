# WP3 - Build a sandbox and test available services - containerize

> Insert initial description

## Task 3-1: Sandbox platform
The main goal for this task was to describe a blueprint for Ã¥ sandbox environment and implement a cloud platform as infrastructure as code. These deliveries should serve as a foundation for the service containerization deliveries in Task 3-2. 

### D3.1.1 - Blueprint for the platform
The blueprint document produced covers the following issues: 
* Background, including the rationale for establishing a infrastructure platform, capabilities of such a platform and how it is linked to WP2: Define integration and architecture guidelines.
* Providing services describes the base capabilities and considerations for establishing a cloud platform, including scaling, containerization, environment and cloud.
* Developing services discusses the reasoning for open source and licensing as well as considerations and principles to consider for collaboration and sharing of services.
* Overall security and logging describes some concepts and patterns for handling security and logging. 

Delivery 3.1.2 demonstrates how the infrastructure is documented as code in order to enable NSIs to create their own modern infrastructure. Together with the deliveries in Task 3-2: Service containerization it shows the implemenation of a container-based platform using cloud infrastructure as "Shared Statistical Services" following CSPA standards and princples.

### D3.1.2 - Cloud platform implementing the blueprint
Implementing the blueprint document is a guideline for how the project has implemented the platform and the containerization of services. "Infrastructure as code" should be seen as part of the delivery and enables NSIs to establish their own infrastructure in their own ecosystem. 

The document produces covers the following issues: 
* Containers: application containerization, docker compose, CI and examples
* Platform deployathons: Building a platform, deploying services, packaging
* PXWeb on Azure
* Try the GCP platform yourself (as a step by step guide to create a Google cloud project and a service account)

## Task 3-2: Service containerization

> Consider a general description on service containerization and eventually refer to other relevant documents and 

### D3.2.1 - Package container for Service 1 (ARC)

### D3.2.2 - Package container for Service 2 (PXWeb)

### D3.2.3 - Package container for Service 3 (Relais)

## Task 3.3: Reporting
This delivery is a report on lessons learned based on the work and deliveries in Task 3.1 and 3.2 as well as the relation to deliveries in WP1 and WP2.
