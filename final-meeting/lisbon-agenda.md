# I3S ESSnet Lisbon workshop draft agenda

This is the agenda of the I3S final meeting as it was envisioned before the meeting was moved online.
This agenda is now obsolete. See also [Visual agenda in Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lb4VPS0=/).

## Day 1, April 26th
 
### [10:00-12:30] Consortium meeting (resp. FR)

The consortium will present the project's result to Eurostat

Also finalization of the workshop's organization (proceeding notes,etc.)

### [14:00-17:00] Session 1 - ESSnet results (resp. FR)

General presentations about the ESSnet and its results

## Day 2, April 27th

### [10:00-12:30] Session 2 - Detailed presentations on the main deliverables (resp. PT)

Each session will consist of a presentation followed by a more hands-on activity (tutorial, "bring your own use case", etc.). Might have to be organized in parallel tracks.

### [14:00-17:00] Session 3 - CSPA session (find a better name?) (resp. SE)

  * presentation of CSPA 2.0 (30 minutes)
  * the catalogue (30 minutes)

  * coffee break
  * discussion on the requirements that make it easier to reuse a service or implement sharable services or put it in practice
  * VTL presentation (1 hour)

## Day 3, April 28th
 
### [10:00-12:30] Session 4 - Interactive sessions (resp. IT)

  * foot voting, breakout groups, etc.
  * Contenairisation for dummies
  * architecture with an interactive session
  * "I build my statistical process with the services in the Catalogue", in small groups

### [14:00-17:00] Session 5 - â€œMore hands-on" (resp. NO)

  * bring your own data in PXWeb or Relais
  * bring your own app in the platform
  * practical session on the IS2 Workbench
  * external inputs (requires call for contributions)
  * sustainability / what next?

## Other ideas

  * presentation of the awesome list by CBS?
  * open source strategy of NSIs?
  * more than "containerisation for dummies": "cloud for dummies"
  * presentations by services owners and users
