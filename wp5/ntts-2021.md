# NTTS 2021

## Context

We are invited to prepare a "stimulating presentation" that will showcase our ideas and engage the virtual audience, and a pre-recorded video which should be maximum 10 minutes long (hard max). It is not entirely clear if the NTTS presentation itself is just a playback of the pre-recorded video or if it is live.

Decided to adapt the Miro interactive presentation and add voice-over.


## Messages

  * "Infomercial" approach
  * Must engage non-specialists
  * Promote ESS open-source communities in conclusion


## Storyboard

  * Start as a "classical" PowerPoint slide listing the woes of the IT manager (read with dull voice)
  * Zoom out: the audience is bored (see PowerPoint poisoning)
  * Mauro interupts: "Haven't you heard about I3S?" (Mauro's voice until the end, or do we go on with a dialog?)
  * Zoom out to a global view of the whole building
  * List main contributions of the ESSnet (should ideally resonate with the PP bullet points)
  * Each time, zoom to the corresponding part of the building
  * At the end, back to the initial room and zoom on a whiteboard with main conclusions

## Procedure

  * Complete detailed [script](ntts-2021-script.md) before Friday 12 (all)
  * Jakob records video of animation with voice of IT manager and sends it on Wedenesday
    * We can also generate the IT manager's voice with Text-to-Speech software
	* Actually it is probably better to record the voice separately
  * Mauro does the rest of the voice over
