00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:01.800
ARC software by Manuel Soulier
developer at Insee - Orléans

2
00:00:02.10 --> 00:00:05.000
ARC software:
what are we talking about?

3
00:00:05.49 --> 00:00:10.530
ARC is a software developed
at Insee and put in production in 2013 

4
00:00:10.53 --> 00:00:13.410
whose acronym signifies 
Acquisition, Reception, Control. 

5
00:00:13.41 --> 00:00:17.080
ARC proposes an implementation of 
the "file acquisition" part. 

6
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:21.000
What does ARC consist of?

7
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:27.650
Functionally, ARC covers the five 
first phases of the GSBPM process.

8
00:00:27.65 --> 00:00:31.580
This means that ARC knows how to integrate 
the data of a file,  

9
00:00:31.58 --> 00:00:33.530
correct them, perform controls 

10
00:00:33.53 --> 00:00:36.440
from recoding up to the creation of 
elementary statistical units 

11
00:00:36.44 --> 00:00:42.170
A characteristic of ARC is to leave 
great liberty to the statistician.

12
00:00:42.17 --> 00:00:45.890
He writes the rules that configure 
the treatments made by the software 

13
00:00:45.89 --> 00:00:49.850
and that select these treatments
according to the file received. 

14
00:00:51.89 --> 00:00:54.470
This functionality is quite interesting 
because it means that several 

15
00:00:54.47 --> 00:00:57.515
versions of the treatments can 
coexist within the ARC software. 

16
00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:02.330
Thus, ARC can process simultaneously
files that have different versions 

17
00:01:02.33 --> 00:01:04.760
or natures and to treat them adequatly. 

18
00:01:04.76 --> 00:01:10.670
In the final process, the user 
maps the data from the files 

19
00:01:10.67 --> 00:01:13.430
to one or several models of 
elementary statistical units, 

20
00:01:13.43 --> 00:01:16.640
the user masters the structure 
of these models and their evolution. 

21
00:01:16.64 --> 00:01:22.490
ARC also proposes isolated spaces called 
sandboxes where

22
00:01:22.49 --> 00:01:29.090
users can test their rules on 
rule sets or small files.

23
00:01:29.09 --> 00:01:33.220
And when the user is satisfied with 
his rules, he can shift them and

24
00:01:33.22 --> 00:01:37.400
use them in production mode.
All the ARC functionalities  

25
00:01:37.4 --> 00:01:39.800
that I just described, namely 
the configuration of the treatments, 

26
00:01:39.8 --> 00:01:43.520
the execution of the process or 
the mapping of the results into  

27
00:01:43.52 --> 00:01:48.110
models of elementary statistical units
are also available through web services if  

28
00:01:48.11 --> 00:01:50.450
one wants to use ARC in a 
machine to machine architecture. 

29
00:01:50.45 --> 00:01:55.130
Finally, ARC proposes a batch 
implementation of the services 

30
00:01:55.13 --> 00:01:59.450
which allows to treat massive flows of files 
or voluminous data. 

31
00:02:00.80 --> 00:02:02.000
Who are ARC's users?

32
00:02:03.83 --> 00:02:08.180
At the moment, ARC users in Insee 
are exclusively 

33
00:02:08.18 --> 00:02:11.540
large information systems, the big IS owners. 

34
00:02:11.54 --> 00:02:14.990
The first that can be mentioned is the SIERA,  

35
00:02:14.99 --> 00:02:17.810
the information system on 
employment and activity income

36
00:02:17.81 --> 00:02:20.570
which belongs to the DERA, the Department
of the same name. 

37
00:02:21.41 --> 00:02:24.860
The DERA, is the 'historic' system owner 
at the source of the creation of ARC. 

38
00:02:24.86 --> 00:02:28.100
In the SIERA, one can find 
several ARC instances, 

39
00:02:28.1 --> 00:02:30.890
instances at the entry of the
information system

40
00:02:30.89 --> 00:02:33.770
that will allow us to receive 
the files coming from the outside, 

41
00:02:33.77 --> 00:02:37.460
like for example the 2,2 million
employment declarations 

42
00:02:37.46 --> 00:02:41.750
called the social nominative declarations 
(DSN) that we receive every month.

43
00:02:41.75 --> 00:02:45.770
And we will also find instances of ARC
in the middle of the information system 

44
00:02:45.77 --> 00:02:50.660
that will concentrate the different
files produced

45
00:02:50.66 --> 00:02:53.030
by the different threads of the 
information system  

46
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:57.800
and expose them to downstream treatments.
In this case, ARC is used as an interface, 

47
00:02:59.6 --> 00:03:01.940
which allows to make the
information system more robust 

48
00:03:01.94 --> 00:03:04.460
to the evolutions of the different
chains of treatment. 

49
00:03:04.46 --> 00:03:09.489
Another information system that
uses ARC at Insee is ESANE. 

50
00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.570
In this case, ARC is used to realize 
the acquisition of fiscal files. 

51
00:03:14.57 --> 00:03:17.420
These are files that are both 
very heavy, very voluminous, 

52
00:03:17.42 --> 00:03:20.750
and also very complex, with a very
extensive fiscal classification. 

53
00:03:20.75 --> 00:03:28.850
Another information system that
uses ARC at Insee is Sirene 4.  

54
00:03:28.85 --> 00:03:32.120
and there we move away a bit from 
the nominal use case of file acquisition, 

55
00:03:32.12 --> 00:03:37.910
and we will rather use ARC 
for its advanced functionalities 

56
00:03:37.91 --> 00:03:42.740
regarding the control of XML files.
So, in the case of Sirene 4,  

57
00:03:42.74 --> 00:03:47.150
an ARC instance is invoked as a web service 

58
00:03:47.15 --> 00:03:50.630
in order to perform a part of the controls
on Sirene immatriculations 

59
00:03:50.63 --> 00:03:55.490
that are passed on to Insee. 

60
00:03:55.49 --> 00:03:59.390
There are other emerging users for ARC,  

61
00:03:59.39 --> 00:04:08.960
which are methodologists and statisticians.
We are beginning to propose ARC to these users. 

62
00:04:08.96 --> 00:04:13.400
This is really on the impulse of Istat 
which chose to reuse ARC 

63
00:04:14.36 --> 00:04:23.450
as part of the European project ESSnet I3S
in the framework of its process of  

64
00:04:23.45 --> 00:04:26.090
statistical production.
A little bit the equivalent of  

65
00:04:26.09 --> 00:04:32.780
what we do at Insee in the SES (statistical production
services). This is facilitated by the 

66
00:04:32.78 --> 00:04:36.410
recent integration of ARC into the Italian 
workbench called IS2 

67
00:04:36.41 --> 00:04:42.800
which will include other statistical tools
for file processing.

68
00:04:42.8 --> 00:04:47.690
For example the RELAIS software
which is a tools that can perform

69
00:04:47.69 --> 00:04:50.810
probabilistic or deterministic record 
linkage on files. 

70
00:04:50.81 --> 00:04:54.800
So we can very well imagine, 
with this IS2 workbench, 

71
00:04:55.46 --> 00:05:03.530
to offer to the statisticians to use 
ARC in order to acquire their files, 

72
00:05:03.53 --> 00:05:06.710
work on their data, put them in 
their models as they wish, 

73
00:05:06.71 --> 00:05:11.060
and then, once the files loaded into then models, 

74
00:05:11.06 --> 00:05:15.950
to use RELAIS for linking records 
between the data 

75
00:05:15.95 --> 00:05:19.850
that were loaded.

76
00:05:20.00 --> 00:05:23.000
Before ARC, how was the need fulfilled?

77
00:05:24.26 --> 00:05:27.740
We answered mostlay with development
or maintenance resources. 

78
00:05:27.74 --> 00:05:31.640
Each application, each information 
system would develop their  

79
00:05:31.64 --> 00:05:35.720
own system for file acquisition
and make it evolve according  

80
00:05:35.72 --> 00:05:36.260
to the needs.

81
00:05:38.50 --> 00:05:42.000
Which problems did ARC's creation solve?

82
00:05:43.38 --> 00:05:47.390
ARC first allows to remedy to a disparate
implementation of file ingestion

83
00:05:47.39 --> 00:05:52.340
and to clearly distinguish 
the "file" acquisition part

84
00:05:52.34 --> 00:05:55.730
from the statistical treatments
that are performed downstream. 

85
00:05:55.73 --> 00:05:59.360
Why? Because ARC 
proposes an implementation  

86
00:05:59.36 --> 00:06:01.190
of these functionalities that is a bit standardized, 

87
00:06:01.19 --> 00:06:04.370
even for files that are complex to integrate 
like for example XML files. 

88
00:06:04.37 --> 00:06:12.230
Another problem that ARC helps to solve,
is that ARC allows to more easily absorb

89
00:06:12.23 --> 00:06:17.210
changes in the model or the structure of
the incoming files, 

90
00:06:17.21 --> 00:06:21.170
and it allows also to delay 
the impact of these evolutions 

91
00:06:21.17 --> 00:06:26.930
on the downstream statistical treatments.
Indeed, with ARC we don't need 

92
00:06:26.93 --> 00:06:30.890
to change directly the 
models of the statistical units. 

93
00:06:30.89 --> 00:06:35.960
Rather, the user will write rules allowing
to acquire the evolving files 

94
00:06:35.96 --> 00:06:39.740
and make them fit in 
the current statistical model.

95
00:06:39.74 --> 00:06:45.290
So this leaves the statistician time to make
changes at his pace 

96
00:06:45.29 --> 00:06:47.600
to the chains that are at 
the output of ARC. 

97
00:06:47.6 --> 00:06:54.620
And this can drastically reduce
the cost of adaptative maintenance. 

98
00:06:54.62 --> 00:07:02.660
Finally, in case of bugs or evolutions,
with ARC there is no need to develop and  

99
00:07:02.66 --> 00:07:06.860
deliver a new application.
The use will simply write new  

100
00:07:06.86 --> 00:07:11.810
rules, test them on sandboxes,
and deploy them in production  

101
00:07:11.81 --> 00:07:15.530
when he is satisfied.
He has the upper hand on that, and that reduces 

102
00:07:15.53 --> 00:07:19.220
both the time but also
the resources consumed 

103
00:07:19.22 --> 00:07:21.560
in the production lifecycles 
of the application. 

104
00:07:25.00 --> 00:07:29.000
Is there any tool or demo to test ARC's service?

105
00:07:30.51 --> 00:07:35.680
Yes, as part of the ESSnet I3S project,
we have deployed the ARC application  

106
00:07:35.68 --> 00:07:37.840
on a cloud infrastructure
which is thus accessible  

107
00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:43.660
to all who want to use it
and one can also try ARC 

108
00:07:43.66 --> 00:07:48.970
in the Italian workbench of statistical
tools called IS2 

109
00:07:48.97 --> 00:07:51.370
that has also been deployed  
on the same infrastructure.
