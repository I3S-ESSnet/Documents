**Description**:

This VTL intepreter is an Open Source Java implementation of the Validation Transformation Language, based on the VTL 1.1 draft specification.  The implementation follows the JSR-223 Java Scripting API and exposes a simple connector interface one can implement in order to integrate with any data stores. VTL is a standard language for defining validation and transformation rules (set of operators, their syntax and semantics) for any kind of statistical data. There is allready a collection of connectors that can use open data end points like PX-API. More collectors could be created as part of this project.
