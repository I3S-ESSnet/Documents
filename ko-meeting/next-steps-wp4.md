  - co-development Istat / Insee
  - working stories on reuse cases (ex: INE reuse of PX-web in April)
  - test phases of WP2
  - post-analysis of a reuse case that worked
  - testimonies of end users or participants to ESSnet project, or associated colleagues
  - report on "service market" in MSW workshop
  - post-mortem analysis of an example of failure?
