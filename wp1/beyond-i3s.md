# Beyond I3S

This document lists the possibilities of collaboration between I3S consortiumm members after the end of the project.


## Development of IS2

Overall goal is further development of IS2 and integration of additional functionalities.

  * Develop use cases in more domains
  * Optimize data architecture
  * Improve process and provenance metadata capture
  * Implement distributed treatments for big data
  * Integrate more functionalities (e.g. VTL transformations)
  * Access control and securing
  * Internationalization and translations
  * Documentation
  * Promotion

### Architecture

IS2 is seen as an workbench for the statistician, integrating functionalities covered by ARC, Relais and Trevas. The workbench allows for:

  * The design of the process: sequencing steps, tuning parameters and testing execution on data extracts
  * Launching of the process, once specified, on (potentially big) real data

This perspective goes beyond the initial scope of IS2, so the current architecture does not necessarily address in an optimal way questions like data architcture, security, metadata capture, etc.

In order to propose improvements of the IS2 architecture, it is suggested to:
  * Document precisely the current architecture and its shortcomings (Manu, March 12)
  * Document relevant architecture solutions in particular for data storage and exchange (Romain, March 12)
  * Describe a scenario involving the combination of treatments with ARC, Relais and Trevas applied to voluminous data (Franck, March 12)
  * Organize a Istat-Insee meeting to discuss the documents, potentially involving other I3s partners (Franck, second half of March) 

## Methodological support

For example, support regarding the processing of administrative sources using ARC, or for record linkage with Relais.
