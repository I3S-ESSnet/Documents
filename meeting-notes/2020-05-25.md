### Minutes

**1.1 WP1**

Has been accomplished : the Relais service has been delivered (architecture document, code on the repository, tests on Travis, quality report) ; the guidelines on best practices have been delivered

WIP : ARC and Relais integration
  
**1.2 WP2**

Stats Sweden has over-consumed on WP2 (72 days for 60 budgeted). Transfers from other countries or other part of the budget could be considered.

D2.1, Architecture recommendations : Stats Sweden is still working on it (focusing on the "Why, WHo, What and How")

D2.2, Cookbook : it is necessary to develop the theoretical elements in concrete experiments. It is foreseen for the next Hackathon (examples on Git)

D3.2 : work on examples has also started
 
**1.3 WP3**

Blueprint : there has been a meeting with WP2 in May ; the blueprint is being finalized.

The delivery slips have been delivered for the three services.

The document on lessons learnt is not begun.

**1.4 WP5**

**2. Organization of Oslo and Lisbon meetings**

*Oslo Hackathon*

Normally, the Oslo Hackathon is planned during the week of the 31st of August. It is not known if it will be possible to travel to Norway, or any other countries, this year. Should we try a virtual meeting ? It is difficult to make a hackathon during a virtual meeting, an extension of the EssNet will be a good thing because of this.

Expert from Finland could be invited for the hackahton (Finland is leading the Geostat EssNet).

It is porposed to merge architecture and development tracks, and put the focus on the examples. The resulting group will be too big, a solution would be to make subgroups on particular examples.

*Lisbon Workshop*
