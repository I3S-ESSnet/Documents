### Minutes

**1.1 WP1**

Has been accomplished : the Relais service has been delivered (architecture document, code on the repository, tests on Travis, quality report) ; the guidelines on best practices have been delivered

WIP : ARC and Relais integration
  
**1.2 WP2**

Stats Sweden has over-consumed on WP2 (72 days for 60 budgeted). Transfers from other countries or other part of the budget could be considered.

D2.1, Architecture recommendations : Stats Sweden is still working on it (focusing on the "Why, WHo, What and How")

D2.2, Cookbook : it is necessary to develop the theoretical elements in concrete experiments. It is foreseen for the next Hackathon (examples on Git)

D3.2 : work on examples has also started
 
**1.3 WP3**

Blueprint : there has been a meeting with WP2 in May ; the blueprint is being finalized.

The delivery slips have been delivered for the three services.

The document on lessons learnt is not begun.

**1.4 WP5**

**2. Organization of Oslo and Lisbon meetings**

*Oslo Hackathon*

Normally, the Oslo Hackathon is planned during the week of the 31st of August. It is not known if it will be possible to travel to Norway, or any other countries, this year. Should we try a virtual meeting ? It is difficult to make a hackathon during a virtual meeting, an extension of the EssNet will be a good thing because of this.

Expert from Finland could be invited for the hackathon (Finland is leading the Geostat EssNet).

It is porposed to merge architecture and development tracks, and put the focus on the examples. The resulting group will be too big, a solution would be to make subgroups on particular examples.

*Lisbon Workshop*

The duration of the workshop can be 2 or 3 days. 3 days is long for such an event, and the organisation is a lot of work. The workshop could be t could be the CSPA meeting of the year and be 2.5 days long, but then we need UNECE help.

**3. Administrative aspects**

How much can we extend the ESSNet ? 2, 3, 6 months ? Three months is too short if we want to be allowed to travel to other countries, but we need substantial things to do during the extension. We will ask for an extension between 4 and 6 months.

Insee will contact Pierre Peyronnel to discuss the subject.

**5. Focus on VTL projects and perspectives**

It was decided to include VTL tools as a deliverable for WP1.

At Insee, VTL will be used internally. Insee is developing an editor tool and an engine. Eurostat has been contacted, because Eurostat is also developing VTL tools for validating. A meeting with Eurostat and Stats Norway took place a few days ago (it was the second meeting, the first took place a few months ago). It was decided to have interoperability tests.

Norway will adapt to VTL 2.1 what has been done in VTL 1. In order to go further in VTL development, Norway needs help. Stats Norway is organizing a VTL team on architecture.

Stats Sweden has developed a .Net VTL engine and an editor.

**6. Other business: security audits, CSPA...**

*Subcontracting*

20kâ‚¬ is available for security audits. Insee wants to do it for ARC ; it is a good opportunity for Relais ; there was one 2 years ago for PXWeb, it is necessary to make a new one.

*CSPA*

The question is what to take in I3S project to integrate in the UNECE CSPA project. The services have been added to the catalogue, the Architecture recommendations feed the work on CSPA (idem for the Cookbook), the artifacts catalogue will be completed with WP4 results.

It is proposed to have a specific session during the next hackathon on how to reuse the content of I3S in the CSPA initiative, for this we need somebody from UNECE.
