# I3S meeting notes

## 16 June 2020: Istat-Insee mini-hackathon

### Context

A virtual hackathon between Istat and Insee is held in order to progress on the integration between ARC and Relais.

### Roadmap

The following actions were identified in preparation of the hackathon, by decreasing order of priority:

#### Fix problem with database connection script.

Manu has described the problem in a GitHub issue: https://github.com/mecdcme/is2/issues/26.

#### Re-use of ARC by Istat.

Istat has decided to change the use case and reuse ARC for administrative data. Pina will provide more details.

Insee has provided a [tutorial](https://hackmd.io/@EgVaFRsUQ-ywTiFcXIsWig/rJzPiJp3U#/) and an online ARC [test instance](http://vps770178.ovh.net:8080/arc-web/).

#### Re-use of Relais by Insee.

The re-use case is currently tentatively defined. The data files and the currrent process description are available. Nevertheless, the current process is based on a chain of deterministic linkages, which does not seem to be easily adaptable in Relais. More detail are available at https://hackmd.io/@EgVaFRsUQ-ywTiFcXIsWig/BkcKkvr6L.

#### Abstraction of the database schema.

A data access layer should allow to implement the original schema and the new proposal agreed upon in Toulouse.

#### Service deployment.

Deployment procedures for ARC and Relais should be strenghtened, with specifications from SSB.

Insee has experimented deployment procedures based on the following process steps:

  * The continuous integration process run by Travis CI under the responsability of the Developing Organization publishes the Docker image(s).
  * The actual deployment is then carried out by the Reusing Organization via Docker (Kubernetes, Helm...) scripts and possibly GitOps techniques (ArgoCD, Flux...)

Franck and Romain will follow-up with SSB on this subject.

#### Data and workflow sharing between ARC and Relais.

Manu has adapted the existing "Zoo" toy use case in order to have 3 matching variables, but this needs to be discussed since Istat plans to partially implement deterministic linkage soon. In any case, this will allow to test the communication between ARC and Relais.
