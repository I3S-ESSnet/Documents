# I3S meeting notes

## 16 May 2019: Istat-Insee webconference on ARC-Relais integration

### Context

A webconference between Istat and Insee was organized in order to discuss the integration between ARC and Relais, in preparation of the Rome hackathon.
 
### Action points

The following actions are to be performed before the hackathon:

  * Each NSI to select a use case mixing ARC and Relais with its own service in major and the other in minor
    * Insee: use Relais to deduplicate ARC output data. This deduplication is currently done in a client application of ARC, but it not very efficient. Using Relais can be a good way to upgrade this step.
    * Istat: use ARC to create new variables and upload ARC files in RELAIS for record linkage

 * Select a step in each service which can be mutualized or reused.
    * Arc: format to model
    * Relais: data preprocessing

  * Select a user interface function which can be mutualized or reused (preferably a function used in the mutualized step).
    * Rule editing?
    * Selection of subsets of variables/records? 
    * Data preview?
