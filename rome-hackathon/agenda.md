**10:00 - 13:00 Morning Session** (resp. Benoît)

  * Introduction
  * Update on the work done (each WP leader to prepare short presentation)
  * Agenda and organization of the week
  * Explore more in detail ARC and Relais (short live demos)
  * First discussion on ARC-Relais integration (with Laura)

**14:30 - 17:30 Afternoon Session** (resp. Romain):

  * ARC Relais integration
  * Presentation of methodology and use case for Relais
  * Requirements for reuse, generally and more specifically for ARC and Relais
  * Sharing algorithms (Matjaž) 

## Tuesday 21 May

**10:00 - 13:00 Morning Session** (resp. Jakob):

  * [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G2zPbshQqxjHTGBRYfZUckXi5aqOfX9SGtOsG-MVJUI/edit?usp=sharing) on CSPA work from Toulouse [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsAT8BRDf5bqp44k3Xus2l2pgUJji9Sp079dzCd9thw/edit?usp=sharing) 
  * Brainstorming on the technologies and services for the WP3 platform. Identify capabilities needed in the platform
  * Map the result of the brainstorming with a "shortlist" of CSPA-features (scalability, security, sandboxing ...) that can be partially or fully implemented by using cloud-capabilities/technologies.
  * List pros/cons by implementing these features by using cloud-capabilities
  * Prioritize between technologies for features that can be implemented using multiple cloud technologies 
  * Describe how the different services could be implemented by using cloud platforms/technologies (cookbook with examples)
  * Setup prioritized plan for implementations. Output: a collaborative platforms (perhaps a digital one) with votes on capabilities

**14:30 - 17:30 Afternoon Session** (resp. Mauro; to discuss: split in two groups or not)

  * Description of a statistical service generalized architecture
  * Presentation of the Relais TO-BE architecture and live demo of the first set of implemented functionalities. Application of the morning results to the Relais example.
  * Presentation of the ARC architecture. Application of the morning results to the ARC example
  * First elements for an unified architecture

## Wednesday 22 May to Friday 24 May morning

Three hackathon threads:

  * Track 1: prototype of Relais and ARC containerization (resp. Trygve). Containerization of ARC and Relais (minimum packaging : put the application on a container and run it on a cloud platform; need for a platform). Comprehensive demo of the containerized applications. 
  * Track 2: VTL editor, development of new functionalities (resp. Pina). VTL description. How to integrate VTL in ARC. Agreement on the objectives for this integration.
  * Track 3: success stories (resp. António). Survey on service reuses. Tools for sharing success stories (audio, video ...). Examples in a cookbook.

  
## Friday 24 May afternoon 

**14:30 - 16:00 Closing Session** (resp. Franck)

  * Pitches of the three threads (30 minutes by thread, each thread rapporteur to prepare 15 minutes presentation, if necessary the pitches can be done during the morning)
  * Overview of Eurostat projects (Luca Gramaglia)
  * Unece MSW workshop
  * Toulouse hackathon
  * Roadmap
